## Data and results

 By gathering information on 12 companies and their stock prices for a defined period of time (2017 and 2018), it was possible to write a code to go through all stock prices and results to create an annual assessment of the growth of those stocks and its results.

Where most stocks in the portfolio would have had a loss, however, totalizing USD 17,813.97 (which is still above the initial USD 12k).

This gives an opportunity value to start 2019 with this portfolio as it would be an investment on the dip. All the companies of the portfolio have a solid foundation, so there is a great possibility of a growth in 2019.

## Refactoring code

It brings the advantage of optimizing the code for efficiency. Sometimes, when writing for the first time, the code may have some long and inefficient paths to run.

The disadvantages might be as macros are more complex, it could be hard to refactor the whole code. Sometimes, gathering the important parts and rewrite may be the best option.

## Original and refactored code

The original one was fixed to the values and less efficient. As in the refactored one, it was simpler written (making it easy to understand).
